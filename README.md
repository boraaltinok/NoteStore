## Features
- **Barcode Scanner**: Use the barcode scanner to quickly add books to your collection. NoteStore automatically retrieves book details such as cover page, author, and more using the scanned ISBN barcode.

- **Multiple Note Types**: NoteStore supports five different types of notes for each book:
  1. **Image-to-Text Note**: Capture an image containing text, and NoteStore will automatically detect and convert the text into editable text. You can even crop the image to fit the text perfectly.
  2. **Speech-to-Text Note**: With localization support for Turkish, English, and Russian, NoteStore can convert your spoken words into text. The app detects the language based on your device settings, ensuring accurate transcription.
  3. **Image Note**: Save images directly as notes. You can attach images related to the book or any relevant content you want to remember.
  4. **Audio Note**: Record and save audio directly as a note. This feature allows you to add voice memos or record important discussions related to the book.
  5. **Manual Note**: Create a manual note where you can give a title and enter the note content manually. This is useful for adding additional information or personal thoughts about the book.
